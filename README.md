Since the CSS is a krunker related product, I can only sell it for krunker related product that can be Krunkies or Krunker Items. The rules are set by this page : https://frvr.com/legal/krunker/

I sell my 100% customized Krunker CSS Black and White CSS with a sober design for the price of : 
- 35 000 kr gifted to IGN: HeroNight
  OR
- 40 000 kr worth of Items to IGN: HeroNight

I don't give REFUNDS, since I believe it's a choice you make because you like the css and you are ready to pay for it. I truly believe it's a premium CSS that some ppl would let it private where I take the risk to sell it to people.
