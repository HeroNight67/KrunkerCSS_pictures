# KrunkerCSS_pictures

Please keep in mind that every picture have been taken on PC7 Client, and on windows 10.
Every picture that you will see on this repo are only meant to show you what my CSS looks like.

ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ Notice : I'm also willing to add morecustomization on personal preference, for example: bigger/smaller leaderboard, Custom Icon on leaderboard, replaced name leaderboard, class on main menu, etc.

I sell my 100% customized Krunker CSS Black and White with a sober design for the price of either krunkies or Items:
- 35 000 kr gifted to IGN: HeroNight 
- 40 000 kr worth of Items to IGN: HeroNight

SELLING ON HOLD

I don't give REFUNDS, since I believe it's a choice you make because you like the css and you are ready to pay for it. I truly believe it's a premium CSS that some ppl would let it private where I take the risk to sell it to people. 

Send me a private message on discord: heronight67 if you have more questions.
